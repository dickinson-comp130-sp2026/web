# Homework assignments

The number of points assigned to a problem is a very approximate guide
to the number of minutes it should take to solve the problem (e.g. a
10-point question should take approximately 10 minutes). As stated on
the syllabus, some questions will be graded on correctness and some on
completeness. Only a random subset of questions will be graded at
all. Solutions are provided on Moodle and it is the student's
responsibility to check the solutions to all questions.

Assignments must be submitted in hard copy. Handwritten solutions are
acceptable. Questions must be clearly numbered and must be presented
in the order of the assignment.
