# Pair programming

General principles of pair programming:

- There are two roles: _driver_ and _navigator_. The driver uses the
  keyboard and mouse to write and run code, whereas the navigator
  assists by making suggestions. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

Specific pair programming requirements for our course:

- Work with your partner on a single computer. At all times, the navigator's laptop should be closed. To ensure good collaboration it's essential to use only one computer.
- The driver and navigator must switch at least every 30 minutes.
- Use a tech hub at all times. Ask for help if it’s not working. It's essential to use a tech hub so that both partners can participate using a large monitor. When you switch roles, the previous driver disconnects from the tech hub and closes their laptop. The new driver connects to the tech hub.
