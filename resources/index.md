## Class 1

**Announcement:** This class separates into two separate sections for labs: COMP130-01 on Fridays 3-5pm and COMP130-02 on Wednesdays 3-5pm. Currently there are significantly more students signed up for the Wednesday section. If you would like to switch to the Friday section (and thus receive more individualized help from the instructor and quantitative reasoning associate), please drop your current section and add yourself to the other section.
