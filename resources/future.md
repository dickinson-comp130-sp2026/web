## Class 12

Announcement:
* The reading for Monday is available on the Readings page.
* For this type of discussion class, you are expected read the assigned content carefully and take a few handwritten notes that you can bring to class and refer to during our device-free discussion.
 
Topics for today's class:
* Informal discussion of the *scope* of a variable: most variables and
  parameters are *local*.
* Review of call stack and debugging. Add the ability to step in, step over, step out.
* Printing on the same line from multiple `print()` statements.
* Mini-lab (ungraded):
  - Using the [callstack_demo.py](class11/callstack_demo.py) program from last time, set a breakpoint in one of the functions. Practice running up to that point in the debugger and examining the local variables in each frame of the call stack. Now practice stepping statement by statement to the end of the program observing changes in the call stack and its local variables. Ask for help if you run into any problems.







## Class 11

Demo code: [debug_demo.py](class11/debug_demo.py), [callstack_demo.py](class11/callstack_demo.py)


## Class 10

Social/Ethical discussion I. See Readings web page.


## Class 9

Announcements about homework:

1. Don’t comment out code when turning in solutions any more. We will encapsulate code in functions instead.
2. For homework, make sure to write your code in IDLE and test it. When it’s working perfectly, then copy and paste it into your homework document.
3. For homework, if using Microsoft Word, start with the assignment document. Then you can format the code by using the “code” style. If you get a lot of space between the lines, then use “Remove Space After Paragraph” (select text, maybe right click, look for line spacing option).
4. Make sure your code is in a fixed width font like Consolas or Courier.


Today is mostly review of chained and nested conditional statements. We want to write a function `decide(hungry, tired)` that prints output according to

|               | hungry      | not hungry    |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| **tired**     | get takeout | sleep         |
| **not tired** | cook dinner | watch Netflix |

Example code: (try to figure out for yourself first, don't peek unless you need to) [decide.py](class09/decide.py)

Also Boolean variables and parameters -- see SSG12.

## Class 8


Today we cover chained conditional statements and nested conditional
statements. Example Python code: [convert_miles2.py](class08/convert_miles2.py)

We will also go over sections 9 to 11 of the supplementary study guide, which are needed for lab this week.

## Class 7

Today we cover topics from the assigned textbook reading, including floor division and modulus, boolean expressions, relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=` etc.), logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), conditional execution (`if`, `else`).

Example Python code (but try to do the warmup exercise yourself before looking at this): [convert_miles.py](class07/convert_miles.py), [boolean_demos.py](class07/boolean_demos.py)

## Class 6

Today we cover Sections 4-8 of the supplementary study guide: nested `for` loops; `range()`; constructors; `graphics.py`; methods and dot notation.

Code: [graphics_demo.py](class06/graphics_demo.py), [grid.py](class06/grid.py); other code from today was copied directly from the study guide.

## Class 5

Agenda for today's class:

1. In-class exercise to build familiarity with for loops:
   - A. (warmup) Write code that prints out the result of rolling a 20-sided dice.
   - B. Write code that prints out the results of rolling a 20-sided dice 100 times.
   - C. Write code that computes and prints the average value of the rolls in the previous simulation (rolling a 20-sided dice 100 times).
2. We'll go over the supplementary study guide content about `for`
   loops, which explains how to use the loop variable.
3. Run a basic turtle program.

Useful tip: Learn how to use IDLE's Indent Region and Dedent Region
features, in the Format menu.

Code (suggest don't peek): [roll_dice_once.py](class05/roll_dice_once.py), [roll_dice_100times.py](class05/roll_dice_100times.py), [average_100_rolls.py](class05/average_100_rolls.py), [draw_square.py](class05/draw_square.py)

## Class 4

Important note about the teaching style in this course: Many concepts
will not be covered during our lecture session. It is essential to
read the textbook carefully and ask questions on any content you don't
understand. For example, the assigned reading for Class 3 included the
important concept of _comments_, but we did not discuss
that during class.

Plan for today: We will go over some key concepts from the assigned
reading, especially how to define new functions and how to generate
random numbers.

Code: [border.py](class04/border.py), [roll_dice.py](class04/roll_dice.py)

## Class 3

- Make sure that you have Show File Extensions turned on in your
  operating system. For example, you must be able to see the `.py` at
  the end of your Python files, when browsing folders.
- When opening a Python file, do not just double-click on it in the
  folder view. First open the IDLE application, then use the Open
  command in the File menu.

Today we review the concepts in the assigned reading, including: variable names, keyword, import, dot operator, statement, expression, evaluation, execution, argument, comment, function definition, header, body, parameter

Example programs (suggestion: don't peek before class): [area.py](class03/area.py), [ask_question.py](class03/ask_question.py)

## Class 2

1. Answer questions on syllabus. Especially note the 5 exam dates.

2. Demo: AI can easily do your homework assignments. But it's a really bad idea to rely on it, because you won't have AI in the exams.

3. Interactive textbook: You can interact with the textbook by reading it in the form of _Jupyter notebooks_. Links to the notebooks are on the very first page of the textbook.

4. We will review concepts in the assigned reading, including some of the following: arithmetic operator, type (this is what I usually call a _datatype_), expression, function, function call, bugs and debugging, variable, assignment statement, state diagram, `input()`.

5. [If time allows.] Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/), launch IDLE, run some programs (see suggestions in class 1).
