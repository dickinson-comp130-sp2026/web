## In-class activity: Run a Python program in IDLE

1. Install Python on your own computer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) -- look for the Downloads link. 
   * You must use a computer, not a tablet.
   * If you don't have your own computer available in class, work with a partner in class and complete this activity later on your own computer.
   * If you don't have access to a computer at all, notify the instructor. It is possible to borrow a laptop from Dickinson for the semester if necessary.

2. We will be using a program called _IDLE_ for writing and executing Python programs. IDLE was automatically installed when you installed Python. Open IDLE on your computer now.

3. Use `File | New File` to create a new file. This will be a _Python source code file_ containing our first Python program. Python files should have a name that ends in `.py`. Before typing the program in, save the file using `File | Save As...`. Name the file `greetings.py`, and save it in your `class01` folder on OneDrive. 

4. Type or paste this Python code into your file:  
```python
print("Greetings. I wonder if COMP130 will be fun AND useful AND enriching.")
```  

5. Save the file, then run the program via `Run | Run Module`.

6. If you have time, paste in more code and experiment with it. For example, try this:

```python
topic = input('What is/was your first year seminar topic? ')
print('Nice!!', topic, 'sounds interesting.')
```
Or this:
```python
import math
x = math.sqrt(2)
print("By the way, did you know that the square root of 2 is", x, "?")
```
Or this:
```python
a = 7
b = 24
c = a + b
print("Also, the sum of", a, "and", b, "is", c)
```

Don't worry if you don't understand the code. We'll learn all about it this semester.
