## In-class activity: Create COMP130 folder on OneDrive

1.  Go to [https://dickinson0-my.sharepoint.com/my](https://dickinson0-my.sharepoint.com/my). This is your cloud file storage on OneDrive provided by Dickinson. You have 500 gigabytes of space here.

2.  Create a folder called `courses`. Inside that folder create another folder called `COMP130`. Inside that, create folders called `classes` and `labs`. Finally, inside the classes folder create another folder called `class01`. Your folder structure should look like this:

        courses
        └── COMP130
            ├── classes
            │   └── class01
            └── labs

3.  I recommend you create folders for your other Dickinson courses here too.

4.  Local access to your OneDrive: So far, we used a web browser to access OneDrive. You should also make sure you have access to OneDrive through your computer's file system. This depends on what kind of computer you have:
    - **Mac users:** Install the Microsoft [OneDrive app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onedrive/id823766827). Open it and sign in with your Dickinson email. After installation, check that you can access your OneDrive files from Finder.
    - **Windows users:** OneDrive is usually pre-installed and set up for you. Make sure you are signed in to OneDrive with your Dickinson email address. You may need to add your Dickinson account to OneDrive:
      - Find OneDrive icon in taskbar (may be hidden, use Show hidden icons), right click, Settings (gear icon), Settings, Account, Add an account -- sign in with **Dickinson** email.
      - Then, check that you can access your OneDrive files using File Explorer.
